# fed_AI
fed_AI is a Nostr-centric, decentralized, federated, pay-as-you-go AI inference network that routes requests across independent nodes. It focuses on low latency, competitive pricing, pluggable models, and privacy-preserving operation without centralized control.

Core intent
- Separate decision-making from computation: a stable control plane coordinates routing, pricing, trust, and metering, while external runners execute models.
- Build a federated market where operators supply capacity and users pay only for what they consume.
- Enforce trust and verification cryptographically with signed envelopes and metering records.
